### RetroArch
- [#4149](https://github.com/libretro/RetroArch/issues/4149) - closed - Last Vita Builds error C1-2738-0 + no Cores - 04/12/2016

~The last 4 Vita Builds have no Cores in them and launching the app with error C1-2738-0.
C1-2738-0 could be a currupt eboot.bin error but I'm not 100% sure.~ Fixed after build 03/02/2015
