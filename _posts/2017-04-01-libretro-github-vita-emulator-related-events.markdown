### vba-next
- [#78](https://github.com/libretro/vba-next/issues/78) - open - (PS VITA) - Golden Sun (S)(Independent) - Crash Invoke Djinn - 31/03/2017

Hi! The crash occurs with the last nightly. During a battle invoking a Djinn, this one executes its attack, in the end it will show the damage to each enemy and then retroarch sends error message.

Attached is the crash dump generated by the emulator.

Thanks!

- [#76](https://github.com/libretro/vba-next/issues/76) - open - (Vita) Wario Ware Twisted (U) - Crash during Dribble & Spitz end cutscene - 31/03/2017

This crash occurs with the latest nightly, it happens when the space taxi cab go offscreen. Since the cutscene is unskippable, I can't progress in the game anymore.
There's another crash in this game with a Mona mini-game but I'm unable to tell which one because it crashes before it appears.

This contains the crash dump generated by the Vita and the savestate before the crash:

### mame2000-libretro
- [#29](https://github.com/libretro/mame2000-libretro/issues/29) - open - PS Vita Mame Menu - 31/03/2017

The R2 button don't exists on PS Vita, in the Mame Cores of PS Vita, the default button for MAME Menu is R2, I think it can be redefined by default to R1+L1, currently is not way to access to Dip Switches and Cheat menu.

### pcsx_rearmed
- [#92](https://github.com/libretro/pcsx_rearmed/issues/92) - open - [Vita] pcsx_rearmed saving states is extremely slow - 31/03/2017

So saving stats or loading is really really slow in pcsx_rearmed.
Also saving cause a very strong slowdown and lagging of the game.

Tested on 1.40.
Other cores are behaving better like Snes2005 and GPSP

- [#91](https://github.com/libretro/pcsx_rearmed/issues/91) - open - [Vita] pcsx_rearmed will stop working after Sleep-Mode - 31/03/2017

So the pcsx_rearmed core will freeze and sometimes loose audio and lagg after the vita enters sleep mode.

This behavior does not happen on Snes2005 or Gpsp.
So I think is core related.
Tested on 1.40

- [#89](https://github.com/libretro/pcsx_rearmed/issues/89) - open - questions about 3DS port - 31/03/2017

* It's missing from nightly for a while, I actually doesn't have a build on my hand, does anyone have a working build?
* retroarch on 3DS show the core name as PCSX, not PCSX-ReARMed, is it just cosmetic or actually a different core? I haven't found a PCSX repo on https://github.com/libretro/, only this.
* I'm guessing the speed difference between 3DS and Vita is NEON support, despite on a much higher frequency, 3DS CPU doesn't support NEON, and PCSX-ReARMed probably used the NEON GPU in Vita builds, is that right?
* I want to help improve PCSX on 3DS, I'm a programmer, have some C experience but I know pretty much nothing about emulation, where should I look into?

I prefer PSX on 3DS over Vita, despite the inferior screen, the resolution is just enough for PSX, and the pixelating gives a *genuine* nostalgic feeling. and it has ZL/ZR for L2/R2!

- [#40](https://github.com/libretro/pcsx_rearmed/issues/40) - open - [RPI2] [BUG] MGS Graphic Glitch - 31/03/2017

This issue is pretty easy to reproduce. Instead of the white flash which usually opens a cut scene there is a pixel mess with a kind of stroboscopic effect. Really weird. Let me attach a screenshot as it's worth a thousand words I guess. The first time to see this it's right after the lift, after Snake takes his swimsuit off. It appears again just a few seconds later when Snake stares at the Hind-D.

I'm using a RP2, latest Retropie version (3.7 final), this core freshly built (but same behavior with the other rearmed core). Core options all by default/auto. No video enhancement turned on or something. I'm using bios SCPH1001.BIN but it makes no difference as same behavior occurs with any other bioses.

As french I'm playing with the FR version of the game (not the Integral or Special version of the game). Didn't try with another version but I could do so if that helps.

Thanks for your help and assistance.

- [#103](https://github.com/libretro/pcsx_rearmed/issues/103) - open - Far polygons are broken when usng arm dynarec - 31/03/2017

The polygon culling on the arm dynarec completely destroys long distance objects, I tested with pcsx-rearmed android, pcsx-rearmed mac and openemu mednafen.
Only pcsx-rearmed android was effected.
Here is an archive of all test screenshots plus 2 broken ones for easy viewing.

I originally thought it was the fault of the neon gpu plugin but after using unai gpu on android and testing it it still happened so all thats left is the dynarec.
