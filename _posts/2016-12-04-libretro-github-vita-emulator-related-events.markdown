### RetroArch
- [#4149](https://github.com/libretro/RetroArch/issues/4149) - open - Last Vita Builds error C1-2738-0 + no Cores - 03/12/2016

The last 4 Vita Builds have no Cores in them and launching the app with error C1-2738-0.
C1-2738-0 could be a currupt eboot.bin error but I'm not 100% sure.


- [#4151](https://github.com/libretro/RetroArch/pull/4151) - closed - Don't need to explicitly demand IPPROTO_TCP - 03/12/2016

Should fix Vita build and not affect anything else.
