### RetroArch
- [#4799](https://github.com/libretro/RetroArch/issues/4799) - closed - [Vita] Mega Drive II roms only shown if 7zipped - 18/05/2017

On my Vita, RetroArch is only showing 7zipped Mega Drive II roms. Zipped and plain are ignored.
I've tried RetroArch 1.5.0 and nightly 2017-04-04, same result. 1.5.0 on Windows shows all formats.
See attached screenshots of RetroArch and VitaShell.
