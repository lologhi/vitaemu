### nestopia
- [#64](https://github.com/libretro/nestopia/pull/64) - open - Fully optional 2x overclocking for nestopia - 19/09/2017

I want the bounty to be put toward a j2me/midlet emulator since I feel taking it would be a conflict of interest.

If any bugs are found within the next month, I will fix them within a few days if possible.
