### RetroArch
- [#4799](https://github.com/libretro/RetroArch/issues/4799) - open - [Vita] Mega Drive II roms only shown if 7zipped - 15/05/2017

On my Vita, RetroArch is only showing 7zipped Mega Drive II roms. Zipped and plain are ignored.
I've tried RetroArch 1.5.0 and nightly 2017-04-04, same result. 1.5.0 on Windows shows all formats.
See attached screenshots of RetroArch and VitaShell.

### pcsx_rearmed
- [#92](https://github.com/libretro/pcsx_rearmed/issues/92) - open - [Vita] pcsx_rearmed saving states is extremely slow - 15/05/2017

Update Tested on 1.50 15/05/17
Save State is still really slow and causes the core to lag.
Load State is fine and really fast!
