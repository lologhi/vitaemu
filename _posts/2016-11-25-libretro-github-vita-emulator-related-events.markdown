- [#78](https://github.com/libretro/vba-next/issues/78) - open - (PS VITA) - Golden Sun (S)(Independent) - Crash Invoke Djinn - 24/11/2016

Hi! The crash occurs with the last nightly. During a battle invoking a Djinn, this one executes its attack, in the end it will show the damage to each enemy and then retroarch sends error message.

Attached is the crash dump generated by the emulator.

Thanks!
