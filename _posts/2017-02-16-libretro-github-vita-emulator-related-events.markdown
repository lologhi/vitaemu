### pcsx_rearmed
- [#89](https://github.com/libretro/pcsx_rearmed/issues/89) - open - questions about 3DS port - 15/02/2017

* It's missing from nightly for a while, I actually doesn't have a build on my hand, does anyone have a working build?
* retroarch on 3DS show the core name as PCSX, not PCSX-ReARMed, is it just cosmetic or actually a different core? I haven't found a PCSX repo on https://github.com/libretro/, only this.
* I'm guessing the speed difference between 3DS and Vita is NEON support, despite on a much higher frequency, 3DS CPU doesn't support NEON, and PCSX-ReARMed probably used the NEON GPU in Vita builds, is that right?
* I want to help improve PCSX on 3DS, I'm a programmer, have some C experience but I know pretty much nothing about emulation, where should I look into?

I prefer PSX on 3DS over Vita, despite the inferior screen, the resolution is just enough for PSX, and the pixelating gives a *genuine* nostalgic feeling. and it has ZL/ZR for L2/R2!
