- [#81](https://github.com/libretro/vba-next/issues/81) - open - [Vita] Saving state crashes Vita - 11/07/2017

Attempting to save the state crashes the Vita's OS.
It gets to 98/99% and then I get:
```
An error has occurred.
The PS Vita system will be powered off.
```
RetroArch nightly 2017-04-04

Doesn't seem to be game specific. I've tried Pokemon LeafGreen and Pokemon Emerald, same result.
