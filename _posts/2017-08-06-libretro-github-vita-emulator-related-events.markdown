### RetroArch
- [#5249](https://github.com/libretro/RetroArch/issues/5249) - open - [Vita] glui scrolling - 05/08/2017

When using the glui menu driver navigating through large lists of roms/folders (300+) can cause the selected item to move off the screen, this happens when either scrolling up or down too fast. This has been a problem for a while (since glui was made available to the vita?), and still occurs in both latest stable and nightly releases.
