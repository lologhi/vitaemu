- [#86](https://github.com/libretro/mame2003-libretro/issues/86) - open - Sound Problem PS Vita Core Mame2003 - 20/03/2017

In the last version of PSVita core Mame2003, works pretty fast but now has  problems with the sound on many games. like (wardner), some sounds are muted and the others are very strange like bad equalized. before the update when the core works slow, the sounds work great, with the optimization, the sound has problems.

Sorry, my english is not very good.
