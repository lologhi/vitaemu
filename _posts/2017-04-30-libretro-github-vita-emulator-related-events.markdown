### RetroArch
- [#4799](https://github.com/libretro/RetroArch/issues/4799) - open - [Vita] Mega Drive II roms only shown if 7zipped - 29/04/2017

On my Vita, RetroArch is only showing 7zipped Mega Drive II roms. Zipped and plain are ignored.
I've tried RetroArch 1.5.0 and nightly 2017-04-04, same result. 1.5.0 on Windows shows all formats.
See attached screenshots of RetroArch and VitaShell.

No achievements setting for Vita?

- [#4461](https://github.com/libretro/RetroArch/issues/4461) - open - Frame Trottle is disable/not working - 29/04/2017

As of 1.40 Frame Trottle is still not working.
It was working in the early Vita releases back when Henkaku became popular but somehow it got disable.
