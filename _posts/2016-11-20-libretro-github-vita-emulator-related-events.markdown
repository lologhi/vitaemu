- [#76](https://github.com/libretro/vba-next/issues/76) - open - (Vita) Wario Ware Twisted (U) - Crash during Dribble & Spitz end cutscene - 19/11/2016

This crash occurs with the latest nightly, it happens when the space taxi cab go offscreen. Since the cutscene is unskippable, I can't progress in the game anymore.
There's another crash in this game with a Mona mini-game but I'm unable to tell which one because it crashes before it appears.

This contains the crash dump generated by the Vita and the savestate before the crash:
